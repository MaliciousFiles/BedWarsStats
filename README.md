## BedWars Stats
A simple client-side forge mod to display stats in Hypixel's BedWars:
 - Kills
 - Wins
 - Beds
 - Level
 - FKDR
 - WLR

Every stat is colored based on how good it is. There is also a colored square next to each player's name based on a weighted average of the stats.

## Installation
Simply drop the release JAR in the mods directory.

Pull requests are welcome! FYI if you're looking through the code, I was having issues with the Mixin remapping, so if you think some of the code is a bit messy... well, that's why :P
